## Experiments and Plans

MVP: A working guestbook that allows a user to upload an image, add social media information, and leave a message. 

Completed Updates:

1. Build a class library and move methods into classes. 

Planned Updates

2. Implement DAO (Data Access Object) pattern to decouple the data access layer from the user interface. 
3. Add Unit Testing
4. Popup-windows or modals for CRUD screens
5. Allow image service to modify images after creation
6. Implement identity service for DELETE permissions. 

## Origins

This was my first ASP.NET Core MVC application. I used it to develop a workflow in developing ASP.NET web pages.
